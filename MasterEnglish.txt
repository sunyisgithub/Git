Self-Introduction: 

Good moring, Everyone! It's my pleasure to be here to introduce myself to you. My name is Sun Yi. I'm 23 years old. I come from Ganzhou, JiangXi. There are four people in my family, my father, my mother, my elder brother and I. Mention hobby, I rack my brains and regrettably find that I seem to have no any hobby except playing video games. As for art activities such as music, dance and statue, It's certain that I have no  talent for them as a student of Computer Science and Technology Institute, who is accustomed to computer code. The reason why I think so is that I have no the slightest scrap of feelings when faced with any photo of prestigious paintings, even I think some of them are unsightly. 

Next, let me begin the topic I got just now,  XXX.



1. Friend: Who is your best friend? How did you meet? what do you do with your friend? Tell me the way you make friends with others and you think what people should be your friends? 

My best friend is my middle school classmate, Zeng Qiang. At the age of grade two of middle school, all students of eighth graders were placed in new classes after disorganized. Coincidently, he and I were grouped in the same class. The first impression he gave me is active and warm. He was both tall and strong, but he had never bullied other classmates. On the contrary, he was willing to help others. However, the least of perfection was that he was not good at study, so he often asked for my help when he encountered some problems which he couldn't solve by himself. I got to know him at middle school and kept up with him in these years. 
As for friends, it's a better choice to make several confidants instead of many ordinary friends as far as I'm concerned. Therefore, I'm indifferent with persons who I don't recognize. To some extent, it's right that there are people who meet me think me distant because I'm selective to express my enthusiasm on account of my limited energy. After all, in my opinion, I don't have to be enthusiastic about who are very different from me in overlooks on world, life and values. 
That's all, thank you for your attention.



2. What is your favorite sport? Do you think that sports will do you good? What kind of sports are popular in your country? Is it good for sportsmen to do advertisements? Do you think athletes receive too much money from doing commercials? 

I don't like any drastic sports because I'm myopic and I worry amotio retinae when I am doing some drastic exercises. Besides, another reason why I disklike even hate drastic sports is that I had a broken right arm when I tried to imitate pole vault in summer vacation which is at the end of Grade Four. So far, I still remember the feeling of fracture, it seems that the lower half of right arm doesn't belong to my body. Ache and panic occurred at the same time, I didn't know how to do except cry. What's worse, my broken arm wasn't been normalised after asking for help of several hospotals. Therefore, my father specially return to home from Guangdong Province where he worked so as to heal my right arm. During that time, my family got into trouble because of my fracture. Since then, I try my best to avoid any drastic sports because I wouldn't like to repeat the past. 
If it is necessary to choose a sport, I will choose badminton. After all, badminton is not drastic sport as far as I'm concerned. In addition, I had enjoyed it in the past even though I was not good at it. As for events in sports circles, I don't express my views because I never focus on sports circles. 
That's all, thank you for your attention.
